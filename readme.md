# QwikNews Backend

This is the backend service for **QwikNews**, a personal project built to showcase my skills in backend development, machine learning integration, and API design. It powers the data processing and summarization behind a sample frontend at [qwiknews.netlify.app](https://qwiknews.netlify.app).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This API is not intended for public or production use. It is a demonstration project.

## üß† Summarization Pipeline

1. **Scraping**: News articles are scraped from select websites and cleaned.
2. **Initial Summarization**: Text is summarized using `FLAN-T5-Small`.
3. **Refinement**: `DistilBART` optionally improves the clarity of the summaries.
4. **Storage**: Cleaned content and summaries are stored in a structured database.
